# Minimum-Lexicographic-Rotation-using-Suffix-Array

Aim: Given a string S, find its minimum lexicographic rotation in O(nlogn) using a Suffix Array.

Example :
S = “dcabca”

All possible rotations of S are “dcabca” , “cabcad” , “abcadc” , “bcadca” , “cadcab” , “adcabc”.
Among all the strings, the lexicographically minimum is “abcadc”.
